## Workflows

The following workflows are ordered by schedule frequency and start time.


### Sync Community Teams with GitHub

| **Workflow** | | |
| -- | --: | --- |
| | Schedule: | Hourly at 30 minutes past the hour (`**:30`) |
| | YAML: | [`sync_community_teams.yml`][sync_teams_yml]  |
| **Script** | | |
| | File: | [`sync_community_teams.py`][teams_file] |
| | Common Modules: | [`ccos/`](ccos/) |
| | Specific Modules: | [`ccos/norm/`](ccos/norm/) |
| **Env** | | |
| | Required: | `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN` |

This creates GitHub teams for the Community teams and updates their membership
based on the [`community_team_members.json`][databag] Lektor databag.
- The databag is used to:
  - create the [Community Team Members â€” Creative Commons Open
    Source][ctlistpage] page
  - configure GitHub team memberships and repository permissions
- The databag is kept up-to-date by [Push data to CC Open
  Source](#push-data-to-cc-open-source), below

[sync_teams_yml]: .github/workflows/sync_community_teams.yml
[teams_file]: sync_community_teams.py
[databag]: https://github.com/creativecommons/ccos-website-source/blob/master/databags/community_team_members.json
[ctlistpage]: https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/community-team/members/


### Manage new issues and pull requests in projects

| **Workflow** | | |
| -- | --: | --- |
| | Schedule: | Hourly at 45 minutes past the hour (`**:45`) |
| | YAML: | [`manage_issues.yml`][manage_issues] |
| **Script** | | |
| | File: | [`manage_new_issues_and_pull_requests.py`][manage_new_issues] |
| | Common Modules: | [`ccos/`](ccos/) |
| **Env** | | |
| | Required: | `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN` |

This manages new issues and pull requests to ensure they are properly tracked
in a GitHub project:
- [possumbilities project][proj_possumbilities]: _Web Development and Web
  Support_
- [Shafiya-Heena project][proj-shafiya-heena]: _IT Support, Platforms, and
  Systems_
- [TimidRobot project][proj_timidrobot]: _Application Programming and
  Management_

[manage_issues]: .github/workflows/manage_issues.yml
[manage_new_issues]: manage_new_issues_and_pull_requests.py
[proj_possumbilities]: https://github.com/orgs/creativecommons/projects/23/views/1
[proj-shafiya-heena]: https://github.com/orgs/creativecommons/projects/22/views/1
[proj_timidrobot]: https://github.com/orgs/creativecommons/projects/15/views/1


###  Normalize Repos

| **Workflow** | | |
| -- | --: | --- |
| | Schedule: | Hourly at 45 minutes past the hour (`**:45`) |
| | YAML: | [`normalize_repos.yml`][norm_pr_yml] |
| **Script** | | |
| | File: | [`normalize_repos.py`][norm_file] |
| | Common Modules: | [`ccos/`](ccos/) |
| | Specific Modules: | [`ccos/norm/`](ccos/norm/) |
| **Env** | | |
| | Required: | `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN` |

This ensures that all active repositories in the creativecommons
GitHub organization are consistent in the following ways:
- They have all the labels defined in `labels.yml` present.
- They have standard branch protections set up (with some exceptions).

This will only update color and description of existing labels or create
new labels. It will never delete labels.

[norm_pr_yml]: .github/workflows/normalize_repos.yml
[norm_file]: normalize_repos.py


### Push data to CC Open Source

| **Workflow** | | |
| -- | --: | --- |
| | Schedule: | Daily at midnight:15 (`00:15`) |
| | YAML: | [`push_data_to_ccos.yml`][push_ccos_yml] |
| **Script** | | |
| | File: | [`push_data_to_ccos.py`][data_file] |
| | Common Modules: | [`ccos/`](ccos/) |
| | Specific Modules: | [`ccos/data/`](ccos/data/) |
| **Env** | | |
| | Required: | `ADMIN_ASANA_TOKEN` |
| | Required: | `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN` |

This retreives data from Asana, formats it as a lektor databag, and pushes it
to CC Open Source website source repository:
- Data Source: [Community Team Tracking - Asana][asana] (limited access)
- Data Destination:
  - [`creativecommons/ccos-website-source`][ccos_source]
    - [`databags/community_team_members.json`][db_community]
    - [`databags/repos.json`][db_repos]

The destination data is used by the following pages:
- [Community Team Members â€” Creative Commons Open Source][ctlistpage]
- [Open Source Projects â€” Creative Commons Open Source][osproj]

[push_ccos_yml]: .github/workflows/push_data_to_ccos.yml
[data_file]: push_data_to_ccos.py
[ctlistpage]: https://opensource.creativecommons.org/community/community-team/members/
[osproj]: https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/projects/
[asana]: https://app.asana.com/0/1172465506923657/list
[ccos_source]: https://github.com/creativecommons/ccos-website-source
[db_community]: https://github.com/creativecommons/ccos-website-source/blob/main/databags/community_team_members.json
[db_repos]: https://github.com/creativecommons/ccos-website-source/blob/main/databags/repos.json


### Eanble Workflows

| **Workflow** | | |
| -- | --: | --- |
| | Schedule: | Monthly on the 1st at 22:22 |
| | YAML: | [`enable_workflows.yml`][enable_workflows_yml] |
| **Script** | | |
| | File: | [`enable_workflows.py`][enable_workflows_file] |
| | Common Modules: | [`ccos/`](ccos/) |
| **Env** | | |
| | Required: | `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN` |

Enable GitHub Action workflows for specified repositories (ensures that they
are not disabled due to inactivity).

For more information, see [Prevent scheduled GitHub Actions from becoming disabled - Stack Overflow][prevent_scheduled].

[enable_workflows_yml]: .github/workflows/enable_workflows.yml

## Environment Variables

- `ADMIN_ASANA_TOKEN`: Asana token with access to the Creative Commons Asana
  organization
- `ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub token with admin permissions to the
  `creativecommons` GitHub organization


## :robot: Automation Authorship

Scripts that commit code or automatically reply to pull requests and issues
need to be associated with a GitHub user account. Creative Commons maintains a
[cc-open-source-bot](https://github.com/cc-open-source-bot) user for this
purpose. This is useful for a few reasons:

- It's ethically important that our community members know when they are
  talking to a bot instead of a human.
- It makes it easy to audit our automations in the future, because all commits
  and messages will be associated with the single @cc-open-source-bot user
  account via the GitHub search, api, etc.
- We won't need to  update automations when there are changes to staff or
  volunteers.

Using this bot clearly communicates when a commit, comment, or action was
performed by an automation. For example, here is some configuration for a
workflow using the [Add & Commit](https://github.com/EndBug/add-and-commit)
GitHub Action:

```yml
# ...other settings here
- name: Commit changes
  uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v4
  with:
    author_name: cc-open-source-bot
    author_email: opensource@creativecommons.org
    message: "Deploy site"
    add: "./example-directory"
```


## Development

Local development and testing is facilitated by helper scripts:
- `./dev/tools.sh`: Checks and updates Python formatting
- `.dev/test.sh`: Uses act and Docker to test workflows
  - [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act): _Run your GitHub Actions
    locally ðŸš€_
